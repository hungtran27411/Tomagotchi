                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with our pet. Tamagotchis are a small alien species that deposited an egg on Earth to see what life was like, and it is up to the player to raise the egg into an adult creature.

                    My interpretation : How healthy can you keep pet Toma in 10 seconds! It is based on highest score so you can pass the digital key around and see who can get the highest score or healthy habits.

                    Feed Button: Will Increase Toma's weight
                                 Will decrease Toma's energy
                                 Will increase Toma's happiness

                    Play Button: Will Decrease Toma's weight
                                 Will Increase Toma's energy
                                 Will increase Toma's happiness

                    Rest Button  Will Increase Toma's weight
                                 Will Increase Toma's energy
                                 Will increase Toma's happiness

                The above will be accomplished using :

                HTML to create the three buttons, feed, play and rest:

                <div id="buttons">  to create the section/group  or division of buttons.
                     creates the buttons
                        <button id="feedButton">Feed</button>
                         feedButton is the id of the button, i will use this as the identifier in javascript and CSS
